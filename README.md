## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the expert advisor's initialization process. In this function, the trade object is initialized and symbol parameters are set. The expert magic number is also set for identification purposes.

## Expert Start Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the selected symbols. It checks if there are any open positions. If there are no open positions, it loops through multiple symbols and checks if the price has returned in a short period. If so, it opens a new position. If there are open positions, it loops through them and closes any position that has been open for more than an hour.

## Custom Function to Check Price Return

The `IsPriceReturn()` function is a custom function that implements the logic to check if the price has returned in a short period. In this sample code, the function always returns true, indicating that the price has returned. In a real implementation, this function should be modified to include the specific logic for checking price return.
